# Getting Started

… [Development Workflow](development-workflow.md) … [Architecture](architecture.md) … [Testing](testing.md) … [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) …

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (includes Docker Compose)
- Git
- Repository cloned locally (see main [README](../README.md) for clone instructions)

## Start Environment (one command)

```bash
./quick-start.sh
```

What starts and why:
- Books API and UI (`books-service`) at http://localhost:8000 — baseline app under test (do not modify)
- Database initialization (`initialization`) for tables, migrations, and sample data
- Robot Framework MCP (`robotframework-mcp`) for test execution via MCP
- RF Docs MCP (`rf-docs-mcp`) for keyword/library docs via MCP

## Verify

```bash
docker ps
curl http://localhost:8000/books/
```

Open:
- Web UI: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Generate Tool-Specific and Robot Framework Information Files

The files in the `template/` folder are **templates**, not tests or config files you run directly. You use them as input/prompts for your AI tool to generate a tool-specific Robot Framework instructions file. Based on that generated instructions file, your AI tool can then create Robot Framework test cases when you prompt it.

The `template/` folder contains two key reference files:

- **Instruction Template.txt**: Example Robot Framework test structure with placeholders for Settings, Variables, Test Cases, Keywords, and Comments sections
- **Test Standards.txt**: Example AI generation rules including Page Object pattern, explicit wait strategies, behavioral naming, and library version constraints

## Steps to generate instruction files for AI tool

1. Generate a **project-specific instructions file** using your AI tool's built-in function (for example, Copilot's "Generate Chat Instructions" which creates a copilot-instructions.md file, or Claude Code's `/init`). This file describes the project, coding style, and how you want the AI to behave.
2. Prompt your AI assistant to create a **Robot Framework–specific information file** for this project, using the files in the template/ folder (Instruction Template.txt and Test Standards.txt) as examples and guidance. This RF information file should capture the RF structure, libraries, and standards you want the AI to follow.

## Generate and Run Tests
When you want tests, ask with a specific prompt for your AI assistant to generate Robot Framework test cases/suites for this project. The AI should use the RF-specific information file as its primary rule set, and may also use any other documentation or project files your tool makes available. Robot Framework suites are saved under `robot_tests/`.

After generating tests, prompt your AI tool to execute them and help investigate and fix any failing test cases.

## Run Robocop audit
Run a **Robocop** audit over the Robot Framework suites using the helper script in the project root:

```bash
./run_robocop_audit.sh
```

This script runs Robocop inside the `robotframework-mcp` container and writes a dated report file to `robot_results/` (for example, `robocop_YYYYMMDD.txt`).

## Stop Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```
